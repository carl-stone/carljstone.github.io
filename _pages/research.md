## Integrative Models of Bacterial Adaptation

Iâ€™m interested in how bacteria adapt to complex environments, and I study this through a combination of high-throughput fitness assays, genome-wide methylation analysis, and comparative genomics.

### Epigenetics in Long-Term Starvation

In long-term evolution experiments with *Escherichia coli*, I discovered dynamic adenine methylation patterns associated with adaptation to nutrient depletion. These findings suggest that epigenetic variability may play a role in bacterial survival strategies.

### Evolution of Subpopulations Under Fluctuating Resources

My collaborative work has revealed how semi-stable subpopulations emerge within evolving *E. coli* communities, with distinct metabolic and genetic signatures. This research integrates fitness data with genomic sequencing to model eco-evolutionary dynamics.

### Virulence Regulation in *Staphylococcus aureus*

As a research assistant at Georgetown, I investigated how branched-chain fatty acids influence virulence gene regulation. Using molecular tools like GFP reporters and mass spectrometry, we showed that lipid signals modulate the Sae two-component system.

### Metagenomics and Microbial Ecology

During my undergraduate research, I benchmarked popular tools for microbial community profiling â€” including mothur, QIIME, and DADA2 â€” using soil microbiome data. This early experience introduced me to large-scale data analysis and the challenges of reproducibility in bioinformatics.
