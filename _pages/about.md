I'm a PhD candidate studying bacterial evolution and genomics, driven by a deep fascination with how something so small and invisible can wield such outsized influence on ecosystems, health, and the future of biology. I am passionate about studying bacterial genomes as both functional blueprints of life and as molecular records of evolutionary history — an archive of how life adapts to challenge and change.

My research combines high-throughput fitness assays, genome-scale analyses, and multi-omics integration to understand how different bacteria solve universal problems like growth, survival, and reproduction. I'm particularly excited about building organism-level models of bacterial function — not just zooming in on individual genes or pathways, but asking what the whole system is doing and how it changes.

I'm currently finishing my PhD and looking toward postdoc or scientist roles that would allow me to keep doing rigorous, exploratory science while moving closer to the biotech world. My long-term goal is to help drive scientific strategy and innovation in biotech, though the exact shape of that path is still coming into focus.

In the meantime, I’m always up for interesting conversations about genomes, evolution, or clever microbial tricks for staying alive.
